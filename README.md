# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Background
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1:
Export of the 'Retirement Titles' table, which corresponds with the 'retirement_titles.csv.'![unique_titles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67697826/198502212-5e594c15-30e8-4011-97bd-0e4b1fd3fda9.png)

Deliverable 3:
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
